Learn to Program: Using Ruby exercises
=====================

Some practice exercises from Chris Pine's intro to Ruby book. These were not made using TDD

###Orange Tree
Creates an instance of an orange tree which grows year by year and produces oranges when it is old enough. The user can choose to measure the tree, count the oranges, pick an orange or wait another year for the tree to grow. The tree may die once it reached a certain age at whch point it will not grow any more and will not produce any oranges. 

###Ten Green Bottles
Prompts the user to enter a number and then prints out the verses of ten green bottles counting down from that number using full english words numbers (e.g. five hundred and thirty five). English number generator uses recursion so number can go as high as required (though clearly printing 999,999,999 verses of 10 green bottles will cause issues!
